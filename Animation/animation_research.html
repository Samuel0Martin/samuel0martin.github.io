		<a>Previous Idea Video: 'Hotel Music Beat!'</a><br>
		<a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F27Yv6MCwxw </a>
		<p>An interesting video - An old idea that I had for a video style.</p>
		<p>I would have liked to make a video based on sounds of various items similar to this</p>
		<p>however I changed my idea because this style would be difficult to make into a review video.</p>
		<p>Does not really match a review or life hack style video.</p>
