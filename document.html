		<a>Which tools / applications were used and why?</a>		
		<p>-	I used Illustrator to create the wireframe as it was easiest to manipulate simple shapes needed to create the wireframes.</p>
		<p>-	I used Paint.NET for the mock-up as it was a program that I was more familiar with and thus I could work faster.</p>
		<br>
		
		<a>How you used the features of these tools / applications?</a>		
		<p>-	Rectangle select - selected images on the screen.</p>
		<p>-	Move selected pixels - Moving selected parts around and alligning them.</p>
		<p>-	Magic wand - To select areas that have a similar color.</p>
		<p>-	Shapes (Square, Curved edge square and Circle) - Was used to draw shapes on the screen. </p>
		<p>-	Line / Curve - For drawing lines.</p>
		<p>-	Text - For writing text.</p>
		<p>-	Color picker - Choosing colors to use on the design.</p>
		<br>
		
		<a>Why you believe your use of tools / applications was competent</a>		
		<p>My use of tools allowed me to create a wireframe & a mockup design rather easily.</p>
		<p>I chose Paint.NET because I was more familiar with it than Photoshop or other programs.</p>
		<p>Easier to navigate and find tools quicikly.</p>
		<br>
		
		<a>How you exported your work and why you did it that way</a>		
		<p>-	I saved my work as a png format because it saves the image in a higher resolution than jpg and can be accessed easier on the web application.<p>
		<br>
		
		<a>How you managed assets during project work</a>		
		<p>-	I created folders with names that I could easily identify and navigate through.</p>
		<p>-	I named files with obvious names so they could be organised neatly</p>
		<p>- 	An example of this would be</p>
		<p>Multimedia / Project 1 / Pictures / reference</p>
		<p>Multimedia / Webpage html files / Pictures used in the application / reference images</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<a>Design Decisions:</a>
		<br>
		
		<a>How you used the elements and principles in your designs.</a>		
		<p>I used elements that I found were used on other book applications.</p>
		<p></p>
		<br>
		
		<a>How your designs are consistent with conventions and existing material</a>		
		<p>I did some research by looking at existing applications and getting ideas from there.</p>
		<p></p>
		<br>
		
		<a>What decisions you made about aesthetics and experience</a>		
		<p>I took a lot of inspiration from the Jump + application and made my design slightly resemble it.</p>
		<p></p>
		<br>
		
		<a>Style Choices</a>		
		<p>I desigined this application in a way that would be intended for peole who read and browse books online or on a mobile device</p>
