					<p>The Apple Review</p>
					<p>Written by Samuel Martin</p>
					<p>Logline: A product review showcasing 5 different varieties of apples.</p>
					<br>
					
					<p>Scene 1</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Action:</p>
					<p>The camera starts from a birds eye view over the 5 apples.</p>
					<p>The camera will then start tilting until it is level and facing the 5 apples</p>
					<p>The second part will be where the camera pans past all of the apples showing one at a time. It will do this from both sides.</p>
					<p>The final part will be a zoom focusing on one apple at a time and repeating this for all 5 of them.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Music:</p>
					<p>Music Track - 'Blue Skies' - Youtube Audio Library</p>
					<p>There will be no other audio in this scene as this scene is about showcasing the apples.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p></p>
					<br>
					
					<p>Scene 2</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Action:</p>
					<p>Starts from an extreme close up of the apple sticker showing which apple it is.</p>
					<p>A shot showing all of the apples will be next.</p>
					<p>For this I will pick up one of the apples and move it off the screen going to a close up where I will take a bite out of the apple.</p>
					<p>This is repeated for each (5) apple.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Music:</p>
					<p>Music Track - 'Claudio the Worm' - Youtube Audio Library</p>
					<p>There will be no other audio in this scene as this scene is about showcasing the apples.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p></p>
					<br>
					
					<p>Scene 3</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Action:</p>
					<p>Will startout with a sideways pan showing all of the apples.</p>
					<p>Then I will show all of the apples from a mid-medium shot.</p>
					<p>Then I will zoom in on the particular apple that I will be talking about.</p>
					<p>I will also show the apples from different angles during this time.</p>
					<p>Will end with a shot of all of the apples and zooming out from them. Will also fade to black during this time.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Dialouge</p>
					<p>Here is my review and thoughts about these 5 apples. Starting from...</p>
					<p>The NZ Roze apple, was alright with a slight crunch to it and a rather bland taste.</p>
					<p>The Simply Red apple was the most enjoyable one, with a slightly sour impact and a nice satisfying crunch.</p>
					<p>The Jazz apple was all around fine, it had a nice taste and a nice crunch.</p>
					<p>The Royal Gala apple was quite soft and really had no nice taste at all.</p>
					<p>The Granny Smith apple was solid, with a nice sour taste and a very pleasant crunch.</p>
					<p>Also, Here is a little display that I found at Countdown. It shows the level of sweetness to tartness for each apple.</p>
					<p>And that sums up my review for these 5 different apples. There would probably be some change in my rating had I chosen a different selection of apples.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Music:</p>
					<p>Music Track - 'Mr. Turtle' - Youtube Audio Library</p>
					<p>The music in this scene will be rather subtle as to not interfere with the spoken dialogue</p>
					<p>When there is no dialogue, toward the end the music will increase in volume for the credits sequence</p>
